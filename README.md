# Task Arithmetic for audio classification

Final project for the **Deep Learning & Applied AI** course held by prof. Emanuele Rodol√† at **La Sapienza University of Rome** in A.Y. 2023/2024.

Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a cost-effective and scalable approach for editing pre-trained models directly in weight space. 
By leveraging algebraic operations on model parameters, this method allows for targeted modifications to adapt models to new tasks or domains without the need for extensive retraining.
The effectiveness of this approach was thoroughly explored in vision and NLP tasks by ([Ilharco et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04089)), who demonstrated its efficacy across various applications.
This project explores the potential of task arithmetic for audio classification problems.
